## ‚ùî About

Welcome to the Question Page repository! This is a web application designed to connect you with people who have the answers to your questions. Ask and answer questions anonymously.

This application was developed as part of [@guiadoprogramador](https://www.udemy.com/course/formacao-nodejs/?couponCode=24T5MT100724)'s Node.js course, with the goal of creating a full-stack application. Users can post questions, store them in a database, and allow others to provide answers.

## üîπ Features

- **Ask a question**: Submit a question anonymously with a title and description. The question will be stored in the database and displayed in the questions section, where others can answer it.
